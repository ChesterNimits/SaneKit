ABOUT
-----

SaneKit is a small framework for interfacing libsane (http://www.sane-project.org/)
in Objective-C code.

I started this project because the only way to get our scanner to work on OS X
was libsane.
Additionally I only found Snac (https://github.com/fredrikw/Snac) to be the only
'open-source' scanner application for OS X using libsane.
However Snac didn't fit my needs because it called the scanimage commandline tool
from libsane but didn't access libsane natively.

This is how SaneKit was born.


FEATURES
--------

SaneKit allows you to search for attached scan devices and then use those to
perform scans.
All options supported by the devices are accessible through the API and can be
set before scanning.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Computer running Mac OS X >= 10.5 is needed.
Xcode and libsane must be installed to build SaneKit from source (see INSTALLATION).


LICENSE
-------

SaneKit is licensed under the FreeBSD license.

-----------

SaneKit can be downloaded from its GitHub page:
